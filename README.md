## üí∞ Business Model

### Payment System
- **Lock Creation Cost**: 0.00039 SUI (390 MIST) per love lock
- **Payment Flow**:
  1. Creator pays the lock price when creating a lock
  2. Payment is held in escrow within the lock object
  3. If recipient **accepts**: Payment goes to the bridge master (revenue)
  4. If recipient **declines**: Payment is returned to the creator (refund)

### Revenue Model
- **Bridge Master**: Receives all payments from accepted love locks
- **No Fees**: No additional platform fees - only the lock creation cost
- **Permanent Storage**: Accepted locks are permanently stored on the blockchain
- **Decentralized**: No central authority controls the bridge or payments

### Economic Incentives
- **Creators**: Pay upfront but get refunded if declined
- **Recipients**: Can accept (locking forever) or decline (refunding creator)
- **Bridge Master**: Earns from all accepted locks
- **Network**: Benefits from transaction fees and storage
